QuickMoov optimizes MP4, MOV, M4V, M4A, and 3GP files for instant streaming by relocating the moov atom to the beginning of the file.

WHAT IS FAST-START?

When you record or export a video, the metadata (moov atom) is often placed at the end of the file. This means viewers must download the entire file before playback can begin.

Fast-start optimization moves this metadata to the front, enabling:
• Instant playback on web browsers
• Faster streaming start time
• Progressive download support

FEATURES

• Drag and drop interface - simply drop your video file
• Supports MP4, MOV, M4V, M4A, and 3GP formats
• Shows detailed file analysis before conversion
• Removes unnecessary free atoms to reduce file size
• Displays video metadata (resolution, duration, codecs, frame rate)
• Pure Swift implementation - no external dependencies
• Menu bar mode for quick access
• App Sandbox enabled for security

HOW IT WORKS

1. Drop a video file onto QuickMoov
2. See instant analysis of your file's optimization status
3. Click Convert to create an optimized copy
4. Your original file remains untouched

Perfect for content creators, web developers, and anyone who shares videos online.
